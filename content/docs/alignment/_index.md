All terms in the library dataset are assigned to FaBiO endeavor sub-classes manually when applicable. There is no 1-to-1 correspondence between a term and a FaBiO class; this is because a term has several conceptual equivalences: document type, document structure, production process, purpose, manifestation, and subject headings.

The class/sub-class mapping is specified in the '*Terms-FaBiO Classes*' sheet below, while the data and object properties alignment is specified in the '*WEMI Fields*' sheet. This mapping is also available as JSON files: [type2class.json](https://github.com/ISE-FIZKarlsruhe/ddbkg/blob/main/config/type2class.json) and [wemi_fields.json](https://github.com/ISE-FIZKarlsruhe/ddbkg/blob/main/config/wemi_fields.json).
