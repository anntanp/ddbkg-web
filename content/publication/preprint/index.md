abstract: Cultural heritage portals have the goal of providing users with seamless access to all of their resources. This paper introduces initial efforts for a user-oriented restructuring of the German Digital Library (DDB). At present, cultural heritage objects (CHOs) in the DDB are modeled using an extended version of the Europeana Data Model (DDB- EDM), which negatively impacts usability and exploration. These challenges can be addressed by exploiting ontologies, and building a knowledge graph from the DDBâ€™s voluminous collection. Towards this goal, an alignment of bibliographic metadata from DDB-EDM to FRBR-Aligned Bibliographic Ontology (FaBiO) is presented.
